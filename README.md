# ⚡ Chaos Engine V3
### Autonomous Multi-Agent Game QA System

> **Designed for the Gemini 3 Hackathon Challenge**
> *Turning dry code analysis into a cinematic, multi-agent adventure.*

---

Traditional static analysis tools find syntax errors. Human testers find functional bugs. **Chaos Engine V3** bridges the gap by using Gemini 3's advanced reasoning to understand *logic and intent*. It doesn't just check if your code runs; it checks if your system can be broken, exploited, or optimized across multiple domains.

## 🤖 Universal Multi-Agent Domains
We deploy specialized AI personality "Red Teams" tailored to your specific project needs:

1. **🎮 Game QA**: Exploit hunters and performance optimizers for AAA or indie game logic.
2. **💻 Software/Web**: Security auditors and architecture reviewers for enterprise-grade applications.
3. **🎓 Learning/Education**: Mentors and concept analyzers to help developers grow and learn.
4. **🎧 Customer Support**: Bug reproducers and diagnostic experts to solve user issues in record time.

## 🧬 Powered by Gemini 3 & Imagen 4
*   **Gemini 3 Pro/Flash (Thinking Mode)**: We leverage the latest `thinking_budget` features to allow the agents to simulate complex logic transitions in their heads before reaching a conclusion.
*   **Imagen 4 (Universal Bug Reporting)**: Chaos Engine transforms abstract technical failures into **Cinematic Visual Proofs**. Whether it's a game glitch or a security breach, Imagen 4 visualizes the impact for stakeholders.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Universal Domain Switching**: One platform for Game, Software, Learning, and Support analysis.
*   **Auto-Language Detection**: Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, C++, and Java.
*   **Deep Reasoning Logs**: Watch the "Live Logs" to see the agents think through edge cases in real-time.
*   **Automated Fix Proposals**: View side-by-side code diffs showing exactly how to resolve vulnerabilities.
*   **Premium Cyberpunk UI**: A futuristic, high-performance interface that responds dynamically to your selected domain.

## 📦 How to Run (Quick Start)

The project is designed to be "Zero-Config" using our autonomous repair script.

1. **Clone the Project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ar48code-dev/chaos-engine-v3.git
   cd chaos-engine-v3
   ```

2. **One-Command Setup & Launch**:
   Run our "Super Script" which automatically handles Python virtual environments, Node.js dependencies, and server synchronization:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. **Access the Engine**:
   - **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - **API Status**: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)

4. **Enable Real AI**:
   The app starts in **Demo Mode**. To use real Gemini 3 analysis, click the **Settings** icon in the UI and paste your [Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Google GenAI SDK 1.0+, Pydantic V2.
- **AI Models**: Gemini 3 Pro (Preview), Gemini 3 Flash, Imagen 4.
