# 🏆 Submission: Chaos Engine V3
**Theme**: Advanced Game QA with Gemini 3 Reasoning

## 🌟 The Problem
Game development is plagued by edge-case bugs that human testers often miss. Traditional static analysis tools don't understand "gameplay logic"—they only see syntax.

## 💡 The Solution
**Chaos Engine V3** acts as an autonomous "AI Red Team" for developers. It doesn't just look for bad code; it understands the intent and visual reality of software failures.

## 🧬 How it uses Gemini 3 Advanced Capabilities
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: We combine three specialized personalities (Griefer, Speedrunner, Auditor) to audit code from multiple strategic angles.
2. **Multimodal Video Correlation (The "Showstopper")**: In **Customer Support Mode**, users can upload a screen recording of a bug. Gemini 3 "watches" the video and correlates the visual frames with the source code symbols to identify the exact line of causality—**Video-to-Code Debugging**.
3. **Reasoning-as-a-Service**: Leveraging the `thinking_budget` to simulate logic state machines internally before proposing automated fixes via high-fidelity diffs.
4. **Cinematic Visual Proofs (Imagen 4)**: Transforming dry technical logs into high-quality 3D visualizations so non-technical stakeholders can "see" the bug's impact instantly.

## 🚀 Impact
Reducing the time-to-fix for game-breaking bugs by up to 70%, allowing developers to focus on creativity while the Chaos Engine handles the "Chaos."
