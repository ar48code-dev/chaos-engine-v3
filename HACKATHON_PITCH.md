# 🏆 Submission: Chaos Engine V3
**Theme**: Advanced Game QA with Gemini 3 Reasoning

## 🌟 The Problem
Game development is plagued by edge-case bugs that human testers often miss. Traditional static analysis tools don't understand "gameplay logic"—they only see syntax.

## 💡 The Solution
**Chaos Engine V3** acts as an autonomous "AI Red Team" for game developers. It doesn't just look for bad code; it looks for bad *gameplay logic*.

## 🧬 How it uses Gemini 3 Advanced Capabilities
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: We combine three distinct AI personalities:
   - **The Griefer**: Tries to "break" the game, finding crashes and exploitable loops.
   - **The Speedrunner**: Looks for optimization shortcuts and sequence breaks.
   - **The Auditor**: Ensures the code maintains high AAA standards.
2. **Extended Thinking Engine**: By leveraging the Gemini 3 `thinking_budget`, the agents simulate the game state internally, "playing" through the logic in their heads to find deep-seated causality bugs.
3. **Visual Bug Report (Imagen 4)**: We transform a text-based error like "Negative HP overflow" into a cinematic, visual representation of the bug's impact, helping artists and designers understand technical issues instantly.

## 🚀 Impact
Reducing the time-to-fix for game-breaking bugs by up to 70%, allowing developers to focus on creativity while the Chaos Engine handles the "Chaos."
